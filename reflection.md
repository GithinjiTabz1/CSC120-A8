Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?



House Class


I created two versions of the House constructor and the moveIn() method to make it easier to use the class in different situations.


The version of moveIn() that only takes a name is helpful for quickly adding a resident when I don’t need full student details during testing.


Library 


I overloaded the Library constructor to make it easier to create a library when I don’t want to specify the number of floors. In the overloaded version, the number of floors defaults to 1.


I also overloaded the goToFloor() method to add a version that doesn't need an argument. When no floor number is given, it just sends you to the first floor by default.


Cafe Class


I created an overloaded constructor that allows one to create a simple Cafe with default amounts of coffee, sugar, cream, and cups. This is helpful for quick testing or basic setups.


I also overload the sellCoffee() method by creating a version where the customer just wants plain coffee (no sugar or cream) which makes your method more flexible for different needs.
 



- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Doing the assignment bits by bits really helped.
The advice I'd give someone taking the course in the future would be to start the assignment early.
